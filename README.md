## Guidelines for torrent-based preservation


- If most files are relatively small, they should be bundled together in torrents of around 15–30 GB each.

  - Few people will seed 400 individual torrents at once; 40 is a possibility. 
  - People will righteously complain about this arrangement; the point is that these torrents are aimed at preservation, not individual use.
- Each bundle should be roughly . Larger datasets should be issued on their own (i.e., as a "bundle" containing a single dataset). 
- Bundles should be issued in a numbered series, with new additions added periodically to include new datasets.
 - Precedents include LibGen/Sci-Hub, as well as the 78-DVD "kolhoz library" collection.
- Material should not be bundled thematically, except by chronology. Because you can't add files to an existing torrent, thematically organized collections become unmanageable over time. Instead, assign datasets to bundles chronologically.
- The fewer individual files in a torrent bundle, the better. If each torrent points to 1000 files, people's clients may crash.
- Choose discreet filenames. The content of a file is a bit less likely to be indexed in a metadata search/surveillance sweep.
    - individual torrents are vulnerable to poisoning attacks


- Include a checksum for each file in each torrent — can be checked easily and used to verify that your local copy is the most recent version of a file (in case a change has been made)


- If a file needs to be removed/revised, just create a new torrent file and link to it.


## Benefits of torrent-based preservation

People don't have to mirror the full set; they can dl one or two torrents and still contribute 

Dozens of torrents instead of hundreds or thousands make the collection easy to grab and seed en masse.

A limited set of sequentially numbered volumes stirs up a desire for completeness in the collector mentality.

Centralized to keep people orchestrated; decentralized enough to afford future mirrors.
